# News Text Classification

This project implements a machine learning-based news text classification system. The goal is to classify news articles into predefined categories (such as sports, politics, business, etc.) based on their content. The project leverages various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and applies machine learning models to classify news articles accurately. The implementation is done using Python and Jupyter notebooks, making it easy for users to understand the logic and interact with the code.

## Overview

In the digital age, the overwhelming amount of news data makes it increasingly difficult to sift through articles and identify relevant content. Automated news classification systems help in categorizing articles into relevant topics or genres, making it easier for readers to find what they're interested in.

This project addresses the need for automatic classification of news articles using machine learning algorithms. It implements a pipeline for preprocessing news text data, transforming it into a format suitable for training models, and applying various classification algorithms.

The entire workflow is demonstrated through Jupyter notebooks, allowing users to experiment with different parts of the process and learn the techniques behind text classification.


## Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: The project covers various techniques for cleaning and preprocessing text data, including:
  - Tokenization
  - Removing stopwords
  - Stemming and Lemmatization
  - Text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF, Count Vectorization)
  
- **Machine Learning Models**: The repository demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms to classify news articles:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
  
- **Model Evaluation**: The project includes detailed evaluation metrics such as:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve

- **Visualization**: The results are visualized using:
  - Word clouds to show the most frequent terms in each category
  - Bar charts for category distribution
  - Performance metrics plots
  
## Usage

### Running the Notebooks

1. Open the Jupyter notebook interface.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open any of the notebooks.
3. Each notebook guides you through the classification process with explanatory text, code blocks, and results.
4. The project covers all steps, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

### Input and Output

- **Input**: The primary input to the project is a dataset of news articles. These articles can be in any format, but they should contain text along with a category label (the target variable).
- **Output**: After running the classification models, you will get predicted labels for each article. Additionally, performance metrics will be displayed to help you assess the model's accuracy.

## Model Details

The project demonstrates the following machine learning models for text classification:

### 1. Logistic Regression
A simple yet effective linear model, often used for binary classification problems but can be extended to multi-class problems. It is fast to train and interpret, making it suitable for real-world applications where model interpretability is key.

### 2. Naive Bayes Classifier
This probabilistic classifier is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that features (words) are independent given the class. It's widely used in text classification tasks due to its simplicity and efficiency, especially with large datasets.

### 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
A powerful model that finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in high-dimensional space. It works well with both linear and non-linear data and is effective for text classification tasks with a large number of features.

### 4. Decision Trees
Decision trees are a non-linear model that splits the data into different branches based on feature values. They are easy to interpret but can overfit if not properly tuned.

Each of these models is trained using the preprocessed news articles, and their performance is evaluated on a test set.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions out of the total predictions.
- **Precision**: The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives.
- **Recall**: The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, which balances the two metrics.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table showing the performance of the model, including false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives.

## Results

After training and evaluating the models, you can expect the following results:

- A report of each model's performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- A comparison of the performance of different classifiers
- Visualizations such as:
  - Word clouds for visualizing the most important words in each category
  - Bar plots showing the distribution of articles across different categories
  - Confusion matrices and other evaluation metrics for each classifier
